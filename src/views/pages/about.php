<?=$this->box("About")?>
<p>My name is Chris and I am a software engineer from Bristol, UK. I orginally trained as a doctor before graduating in the summer of 2021. I am a self taught programmer and enjoy all things related to code</p>
<p>I set up bristol code as a personal project to provide a platform to write programming tutorials and tips. Teaching is a passion of mine and I believe that if you can explain it simply you can learn it deeply</p>
<p>My particular areas of interest include</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ruby</li>
	<li>Unix and bash scripting</li>
	<li>C/C++ and embedded systems</li>
	<li>Programming puzzles/challenges</li>
	<li>Terminal user interfaces and ncurses</li>
	<li>Vim</li>
</ul>

<p>I am more than happy for other contributors to write for bristol code - if you are keen please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a></p>

<p>My other projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/apexatoll">github <i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></p>
